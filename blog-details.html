                  Summer sneakers sound like an oxymoron. When the weather heats up, our restraining
                  closed-toe shoes head for the storage closet. Yet, we’ll be the first to say a
                  really good sneaker knows no season. Their throw-on-and-go attitude is essential
                  for embracing summer's often busy calendar. Sneakers go with just about everything,
                  and this attitude doesn’t change depending on the weather. Simply, it’s not about how
                  to style a summer sneaker and more about finding one that depicts your personal style best.
                  What sneakers you wear tends to say a lot about you—where the maximalist Gen-Z may love
                  a colorful Samba, the more practical city-goer opts often reaches for a minimalist white
                  sneaker, and so on. According to stylist Allison Bornstein, sneakers can lead to a more
                  interesting and personable outfit—a phenomenon she’s coined the “wrong shoe" theory.
                  Bornstein posits that sometimes the wrong shoe (read: a sneaker with a dress, a loafer
                  with athletic shorts) brings more zest into an outfit. This re-contextualizes sneaker-wearing
                  as an intentional choice instead of a functional one.

                      lounging around the house. All you have to do is style neutral pieces together—like
                      white sweatpants and a cozy ribbed crewneck. Then, go with coordinating accessories such as a pair of
